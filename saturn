this is my plea for getting a hub set up on Saturn.
I think Saturn would be an excellent place to set up a base. 
It could be cold there though.
Therefore, you will need to make sure and bring extra-warm clothing.
Except if you plan on going to the hot springs - then make sure you bring a swim suit and towel.
